# define.py
A Simple Command Line Dictionary Application.

SET UP:

---Create a batch file (just a simple text file ending in .bat) that calls python and points to the path of the script. 

---Be sure to allow arguments with %* and that the folder the batch file is inside, is in your systems path environment variables.

---The name of the batch file is what's used to run the script, so for your convenience make it something short like "def.bat"

---The batch file should look like this, except for the scripts path:

python C:\PythonScripts\define.py %*



Very simple to use. Enter the name of the corresponding batch file and the word you would like to define into the run command and just hit enter.
Example:

(Win + r) +
(open: def simplicity) + 
Enter:
