# define.py
A simple command line dictionary application.

Set Up:

-Create a batch file (just a simple text file ending in .bat) that calls python and points to the path of the script. 
-Be sure to allow arguments with %* and that the folder the batch file is inside, is in your systems path environment variables.
-The name of the batch file is what's used to run the script, so for your convenience make it something short like "def.bat"

It should look like this, except for it's path name:

python C:\PythonScripts\define.py %*

Very simple to use. Enter the name of the corresponding batch file and the word you would like to define into the run command and just hit enter.
Example:

(Win + R)
(Open: def simplicity)
Hit Enter
Results:
